        The PetOwners Collective of Newfoundland and Labrador is a self-funding group of volunteers. We are focused on ready access to the cost affordable provision of small animal Veterinary Care Clinics. We also have an interest in contributing to the health and well-being of Veterinarians and support staff. We seek industry collaboration on regulations governing the Pet Care industry.
    </p>    
    <h2>The origin.</h2>
    <p>
        The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program, Marketplace,  aired a two-part program on concerns about the impacts of profit-oriented investment funds purchasing control of local small animal pet clinics across Canada and elsewhere in the U.S and Europe. The program highlighted increased costs to pet owners, lack of regulation on price fixing and oligopoly behaviors of pet clinics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some friends and I had existing concerns about the availability and cost of small pet veterinary services in our area and that this could make matters worse.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Action:</h2>
    <p>
        I called a local call-in radio show to request listener feedback of their experiences with accessibility to and costs of veterinary clinics. The PetOwners Collective of Newfoundland and Labrador had an email address, [petcarenfld@outlook.com]. Within 24 hours, our account received 39 emails from pet owners. More followed.
    </p>
    <p>
        While some shared positive experiences with the empathy, skillset, and services of the vets and support staff, the majority detailed chaotic and unexpected billing experiences and difficulty accessing Vet services when needed. Government taxation of Clinic services was a concern. Sometimes Gov't collected thousands of dollars on a Vet bill. in one case, $7500. Obtaining reasonably priced and enforceable Pet Insurance is a concern.
    </p>
    <p>
        Owners felt they had little or no say or control over their pet’s treatments. They expressed concerns about pet insurance costs and coverages, lack of government regulatory control, a lack of support for clinic staff well-being, and fear of being labeled as troublemakers with pets denied treatment if owners questioned billing details.
    </p>    
    <h2>Research:</h2>
    <p>
        We began gathering additional information to enable us to collaborate with industry stakeholders to deliver enhanced pet healthcare services in the province.
    </p>
    <p>
        We met with the Provincial Minister of Finance to gather any data the province had available on the amount of taxes collected. We also requested the discontinuation of the Provincial portion of the 15% HST collected on pet clinic services and equipment purchases.
    
        The Minister denied our request to eliminate taxes, citing it being a Federally controlled matter. She did however commit to researching the issues. She also suggested she would reach out to her colleague, The Minister of Fisheries, Food and Agriculture on our behalf. There have been Ministerial changes since then. We’ve had no follow-up.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our Group also reached out to the department of Fishery, Forestry and Agriculture. We requested a meeting with The Minister to request a review of the impact of Corporatization of Pet Clinics in the Province and to get a seat at the table when regulations are being reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Director advised that, while the Dept was responsible for overseeing the Veterinary Care Act, we should contact the NL Veterinary College for additional information on regulations governing pet care and oversight of Veterinarian activities. The Vet College, in turn, referred us to the Veterinarian Association of NL for additional information on what we are trying to achieve. Responses to our email inquiries have been slow. There is an apparent reluctance from veterinarian representative groups to collaborate or suggest any cost reduction suggestions, such as removing taxes on vet care. Our request to meet with the Minister has not been responded to.
    </p>
    <h2>Anonymity concerns:</h2>
    <p>
        Pet Owners expressed concerns that by raising issues related to what they feel are excessive or erratic Vet Clinic costs or lack of timely access to service or receiving substandard care, it could result in them being isolated (boycotted) from access to treatment for their Pets.
        Our Pets are family members. There is an understandable reluctance by some to share anxieties and pain as those we love go through illness.
        Some Veterinarians also privately express concern that collaborating with those outside their profession, to identify and solve issues, could result in them being sanctioned in their practice.
    </p>
